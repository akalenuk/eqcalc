eqcalc
======

Semi-console .NET calculator in ILAsm.

I basically just made a prototype in C# and then rewrote it in pure ILAsm method by method. The main purpose was to get aknowleged with Microsoft Intermediate Language and C# compiler capabilities. 

Usage:

    = 2+2

    = -6 + 5

    = ((100+46) * 0.69 - 50) * 2
